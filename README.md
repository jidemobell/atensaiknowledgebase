## üß† Beyond RAG: Intelligent Knowledge Topology

Unlike traditional RAG systems that simply retrieve and inject documents, the Topology Knowledge Platform represents a fundamental paradigm shift. We've architected an **intelligent knowledge synthesis engine** that understands the topology of information‚Äîthe complex relationships, dependencies, and contextual connections that exist within and across knowledge domains.

### Traditional RAG Limitations
- Static document retrieval with limited context
- No relationship mapping between concepts
- Isolated information silos
- Surface-level semantic matching

### Our Topology Approach
- **üó∫Ô∏è Semantic Knowledge Mapping**: Understanding how concepts relate across domains
- **üîÑ Dynamic Context Synthesis**: Building coherent narratives from fragmented sources  
- **üìà Adaptive Learning Networks**: Knowledge graphs that evolve with usage patterns
- **üîç Multi-Dimensional Analysis**: Code, documentation, issues, and discussions as interconnected layers

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### One-Command Launch
```bash
./start.sh
```

Choose your deployment strategy:

#### üñ•Ô∏è **Server Mode** (Development & Maximum Control)
```bash
./start_server_mode.sh
```
- Direct service access and debugging
- Real-time log monitoring  
- Easy configuration adjustments
- Optimal for development and customization

#### üê≥ **Containerized Mode** (Production & Consistency)
```bash
./start_docker_mode.sh
```
- Containerized deployment with isolated environments
- **Docker & Podman Support** - Automatically detects your container runtime
- Automatic service orchestration
- Production-ready configuration
- Consistent deployment across systems (perfect for IBM/enterprise environments)

## üéØ Advanced Usage Patterns

### Knowledge Exploration
Instead of simple Q&A, engage in **knowledge discovery**:
- *"Show me the architectural patterns used across our microservices"*
- *"How do the authentication systems in these three repos connect?"*
- *"What are the common performance bottlenecks mentioned in issues?"*

### Code Understanding  
Go beyond basic code search:
- *"Explain the data flow from user input to database in this system"*
- *"What design patterns are consistently used across these repositories?"*
- *"How would implementing feature X affect the existing architecture?"*

### Documentation Synthesis
Create comprehensive overviews:
- *"Generate an onboarding guide combining all our repository READMEs"*
- *"What are the best practices mentioned across our codebases?"*
- *"Create a troubleshooting guide from our collective issue discussions"*
