Updated Step 4: React UI for the Smart Case Assistant
We’ll build a clean, internal web app using your existing stack:

Frontend: React (TypeScript preferred)
Backend: FastAPI (Python) or Flask (simple, lightweight)
Hosting: Deploy on OpenShift (cloud) or Docker (on-prem) — just like your product services

Perfect — no problem! We’ll go full React UI (which is actually better for control, auditability, and integration with internal systems anyway). Since you're already working with React in IBM AIOPs, we can make this feel like a native part of your dev workflow.

Let’s adapt Step 4 to build a standalone React-based Knowledge Assistant that runs internally — think of it as "Google for Past Cases + AI Guidance".
