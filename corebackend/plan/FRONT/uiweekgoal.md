# UI Development Goals - Stateful AI Support System

## Week 1: Foundation & Architecture Setup
- [ ] Set up development environment (Python, Node.js, Docker)
- [ ] Deploy local Weaviate + Redis + Neo4j using docker-compose
- [ ] Create knowledge graph schema for Cases, Services, Fixes
- [ ] Implement basic FastAPI backend with stateful agent
- [ ] Build initial React chat interface with conversation history

## Week 2: Knowledge Graph & Case Processing
- [ ] Manually collect and structure 20+ historical cases from Salesforce
- [ ] Implement case embedding and similarity matching
- [ ] Build service dependency graph (topology-merge → kafka → cassandra)
- [ ] Add hypothesis generation and Bayesian updating
- [ ] Test multi-turn conversations with session memory

## Week 3: Advanced UI Features & Visualization
- [ ] Create interactive diagnostic flowcharts
- [ ] Add confidence meters and hypothesis probability displays
- [ ] Build case similarity visualization (similar cases panel)
- [ ] Implement "diagnostic journey" timeline view
- [ ] Add service dependency graph visualization

## Week 4: Integration & Tool Foundation
- [ ] Connect to sample Kafka/OpenShift APIs (read-only tools)
- [ ] Implement ReAct-style reasoning with tool suggestions
- [ ] Add "suggested commands" panel (non-executable for safety)
- [ ] Create diagnostic script generation interface
- [ ] Build feedback collection system for learning

## Week 5: Enhanced Intelligence & GraphRAG
- [ ] Implement GraphRAG community detection
- [ ] Add multi-hop reasoning across service dependencies  
- [ ] Create automated diagnostic pattern recognition
- [ ] Build "similar resolution paths" recommendation engine
- [ ] Add real-time learning from user feedback

## Week 6: Production Readiness & Deployment
- [ ] Optimize for OpenShift deployment
- [ ] Add authentication and session management
- [ ] Implement audit logging for compliance
- [ ] Create performance monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Deploy beta version for team testing
