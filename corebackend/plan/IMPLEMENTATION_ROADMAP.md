# AI-Powered Enterprise Support System - Implementation Roadmap

## Vision: Beyond Basic RAG
Building a **cognitive copilot for software support** that thinks like a senior developer, not just a search engine.

## Core Principles
1. **Stateful Reasoning**: Maintains context across interactions
2. **Graph-Based Knowledge**: Understanding service dependencies and case relationships  
3. **Action-Oriented**: Provides resolution pathways, not just information
4. **Self-Improving**: Learns from successful resolutions

## Phase-by-Phase Implementation

## Technology Stack

### Core Framework
- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript
- **Agent Framework**: LangGraph (LangChain)
- **Memory**: Redis for session state
- **Vector DB**: Weaviate (combined vector + graph)
- **Alternative**: Pinecone + Neo4j

### AI/ML Components
- **LLM**: IBM Granite models (enterprise-safe)
- **Embeddings**: sentence-transformers or Granite embeddings
- **Reasoning**: ReAct, DSPy for prompt optimization
- **Graph**: Neo4j or Weaviate's graph capabilities

### Integration
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana
- **Deployment**: OpenShift, Docker
- **CI/CD**: IBM toolchain
- **Security**: IBM Cloud Security

## Key Differentiators from Basic RAG

1. **Relationship-Aware**: Understands service dependencies
2. **Stateful**: Remembers conversation context and reasoning
3. **Action-Oriented**: Suggests specific steps, not just information  
4. **Tool-Augmented**: Can interact with actual systems
5. **Self-Learning**: Improves from successful resolutions
6. **Enterprise-Grade**: IBM security and deployment standards

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1-2
- Case similarity matching accuracy > 85%
- Multi-turn conversation coherence
- Reduction in information gathering time

### Phase 3-4  
- Automated diagnostic accuracy > 70%
- Developer time savings > 30%
- Case resolution time improvement > 25%

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Data Privacy**: All processing on IBM infrastructure
2. **Tool Safety**: Sandboxed execution, read-only tools initially
3. **Gradual Deployment**: Team-by-team rollout
4. **Fallback**: Always provide human escalation path
5. **Monitoring**: Continuous accuracy and performance tracking

## Next Steps

1. **Week 1**: Set up development environment and initial architecture
2. **Stakeholder Buy-in**: Present this roadmap to team leads
3. **Data Collection**: Begin systematic case collection and categorization
4. **Proof of Concept**: Build minimal viable version for internal testing
