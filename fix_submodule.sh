echo "ðŸ”§ SUBMODULE FIX INSTRUCTIONS"
echo "============================"
echo ""
echo "1. First, create a fork of OpenWebUI:"
echo "   â€¢ Go to: https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui"
echo "   â€¢ Click 'Fork' button"
echo "   â€¢ Wait for fork to be created at: https://github.com/jidemobell/open-webui"
echo ""
echo "2. Then run these commands to push your Knowledge Fusion integration:"
echo ""
echo "   cd openwebuibase"
echo "   git push fork main"
echo "   cd .."
echo "   git add .gitmodules"
echo "   git commit -m 'Update submodule to use forked OpenWebUI repository'"
echo "   git push"
echo ""
echo "3. After this, your GitHub repository will properly display the submodule!"
echo ""
echo "Why this is needed:"
echo "â€¢ Your local commits only exist on your machine"
echo "â€¢ GitHub needs to find those commits in a public repository"
echo "â€¢ By forking and pushing, you make those commits available publicly"
echo ""
echo "Benefits of this approach:"
echo "â€¢ âœ… Proper submodule display on GitHub"
echo "â€¢ âœ… Team members can clone with --recursive"
echo "â€¢ âœ… Your Knowledge Fusion integration is preserved"
echo "â€¢ âœ… You can still pull updates from original OpenWebUI"
