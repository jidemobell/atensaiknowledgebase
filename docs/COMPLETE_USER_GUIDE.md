## Platform Overview

### üß† What is Knowledge Fusion?

Knowledge Fusion is a next-generation AI platform that **goes beyond traditional RAG and multi-agent systems** by implementing:

- **Temporal Knowledge Synthesis**: Understands how knowledge evolves over time
- **Multi-Source Intelligence**: Fuses insights from code, documents, conversations, and real-time data
- **Predictive Reasoning**: Anticipates future trends and provides proactive insights
- **Dynamic Learning**: Continuously adapts and improves from interactions

### üéØ Key Differentiators

| Traditional Systems | Knowledge Fusion Platform |
|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Static retrieval (RAG) | Dynamic temporal synthesis |
| Single-turn responses | Continuous knowledge evolution |
| Document-based only | Multi-modal source fusion |
| Reactive assistance | Predictive intelligence |
| Fixed knowledge base | Self-improving knowledge graph |

## Theory of Design

### üî¨ Core Architectural Principles

#### 1. **Temporal Knowledge Intelligence**
Traditional systems treat knowledge as static snapshots. Our platform recognizes that knowledge has **temporal dimensions**:

- **Historical Context**: Understanding how concepts evolved
- **Current State**: Real-time knowledge synthesis
- **Future Projection**: Predictive insights and trend analysis

    A[Historical Data] --> D[Temporal Synthesis Engine]
    B[Current Analysis] --> D
    C[Predictive Models] --> D
    D --> E[Contextualized Intelligence]
```

#### 2. **Multi-Source Fusion Architecture**
Instead of simple document retrieval, we implement **intelligent source fusion**:

- **GitHub Repositories**: Code patterns, development trends
- **Documentation**: Technical specifications, best practices
- **Conversation History**: Learning from user interactions

- **Knowledge Graphs**: Relationship modeling and inference

#### 3. **Adaptive Intelligence Framework**
The system continuously learns and adapts:

- **Knowledge Weighting**: Dynamically adjusts source credibility
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies recurring themes and solutions
- **Preference Learning**: Adapts to user patterns and preferences
- **Conflict Resolution**: Intelligently handles contradictory information

## Troubleshooting

### üîß Common Issues and Solutions

#### Startup Problems

**Issue**: OpenWebUI shows "Not Found" error
```bash
# Solution: Check if frontend is properly built
curl http://localhost:3000
# If getting {"detail": "Not Found"}, the frontend is missing

# Reinstall OpenWebUI with frontend
source openwebui_venv/bin/activate
pip install open-webui --upgrade --force-reinstall
```

**Issue**: Knowledge Fusion not accessible
```bash
# Check if service is running
curl http://localhost:8002/docs
# If connection refused, check logs
tail -f logs/knowledge_fusion.log
```

**Issue**: Core Backend connection failed
```bash
# Verify backend is running
curl http://localhost:8001/health
# Check process status
ps aux | grep uvicorn
```

#### Performance Issues

**Slow Response Times**
1. **Check System Resources**
   ```bash
   # Monitor CPU and memory usage
   top -pid $(pgrep -f "open-webui\|uvicorn\|ollama")
   ```

2. **Optimize Model Selection**
   - Use smaller models for faster responses
   - Consider quantized models for resource-constrained systems
